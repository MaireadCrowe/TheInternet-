  <h2 align="center">Range  of Purposes</h2>
  <p>There are many uses for the internet including  communication, information search, file sharing/downloading and e Commerce. We  will outline each of these. <br>
    
<h3 id ="MyHeading1">Communication:</h3>
	    
    Voice Communication: Audio  conferencing, video conferencing and VoIP. <br>
    Audio conferencing is a connection between  two computers. The participants need access to a microphone and speakers in  order to communicate. Examples would be Skype or AOL.</p>
	
	
<p>Video/Wed Conferencing is similar to audio  conferencing. The main difference between the two is that users are able to see  each other.  A webcam is required to use  this service. Zoom and Teams are examples of video conferencing. </p>
	
  <p> VoIP,  stands for Voice over Internet protocol. It is a phone service through an  internet connected. Users of this are required to have an adapter and a unique  phone number. The user can send and receive calls using a computer. Examples of  VoIP are WhatsApp and Viber.<br>

    Written Communication:  Email, Instant Messaging, IRC, SMS and Wireless Communications.<br>
    Email is the transmission of messages over  communications networks. In order to communicate with others, you require the  recipients email address. Gmail and Outlook are examples of companies that host  your email. Email is a very quick and effective way to communicate as it only  takes seconds to arrive at its destination. A downside of email is spam and the  potential viruses that it could contain. </p>
	
  <p>Instant messaging is a text-based chat. It  allows users to chat privately with another user over the Internet in real  time. This is beneficial when you are looking to contact someone quickly as you  can see if the person you want to speak with is online and a notification will  appear on their screen immediately. </p>
	
  <p>IRC stand for Internet Relay Chat. It is a  multi-user chat system which allows people to talk in &ldquo;rooms&rdquo; privately. </p>
	
  <p>SMS and Wireless Communications SMS is  short for short message service. It is a global wireless service that allows  transmission of messages between mobile phone users. </p>
	
  <h3 id ="MyHeading2">Information Search:</h3>
	
  <p>&ldquo;Google it&rdquo; is a common phrase we hear every day. It  has the answers to all our questions. We use a search engine which is a program  that searches for specific keywords and returns a list of documents found where  the keywords were found. The more detailed the search request, the more  accurate results are found. A search engine used an algorithm to create its  directory so that ideally only correct results are returned. </p>
	<img src="images/google.jfif" width="474" height="174" alt=""/>
<h3 id ="MyHeading3">File  Sharing/Downloading: </h3>
    
	File Sharing:<br>
    <p>This is  the public or private sharing of computer data or space in a network. There are  various levels of access of the data. File sharing allows multiple people to  use the same file. The user can read, modify, copy or print it, again depending  on the level of access granted by the administrator.<br>
    File Downloading: <br>
	<img src="images/file sharing.jfif" width="310" height="186" alt=""/>
		Peer to peer file sharing. This is when users can use software that  connects to a peer to peer network to search for shared files on the computers  of other users who are also connected to the network. This type of sharing was  heavily used for sharing music and films. Popular networks are Limewire and  PirateBay. <br>
  <br>
    File hosting services are a simplified version of peer to peer software.  They can be used with Internet collaboration tools like email, forums or blogs.  These sites host files so that others can download them. </p>
	
  <p>File sync and sharing allows the user to access files on a network such  as Google Drive or OneDrive. These files can be updated and the user will have  instant access to the live update using the cloud-based service. These files  can be accessed or shared easily through a website or mobile app. </p>
	
  <h3 id ="MyHeading4">ECommerce:</h3>
	
   <p> Ecommerce is the buying and selling of goods  and services over the internet. There are four main types of E Business models.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Business to Business</li>
    <li>Consumer to Consumer</li>
    <li>Consumer to Business</li>
    <li>Business to Consumer</li>
